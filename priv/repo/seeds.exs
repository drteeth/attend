# Script for populating the database. You can run it as:
#
#     mix run priv/repo/seeds.exs
#
# Inside the script, you can read and write to any of your
# repositories directly:
#
#     Attend.Repo.insert!(%Attend.SomeSchema{})
#
# We recommend using the bang functions (`insert!`, `update!`
# and so on) as they will fail if something goes wrong.

# names = [
#   "The Noodles",
#   "The Hairballs",
#   "Sauce FC",
#   "The Chammptions"
# ] |> Enum.each(fn name ->
#   {:ok, _} = Attend.register_team(name)
# end)
